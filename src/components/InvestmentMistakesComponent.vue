    <h3 class="mb-2">
      Insufficient understanding of fundamental cryptographic principles
    </h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Newcomers in the field of cryptocurrency might find themselves drawn
      towards the hype encompassing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.
      However, comprehending the nature and functioning of this asset class is
      imperative before diving into crypto investments. Engaging in investment
      involving an unfamiliar asset or attempting to trade cryptocurrency
      without a fundamental understanding of its workings can lead to disastrous
      outcomes. Becoming well-informed about various cryptocurrency projects and
      the objectives of each crypto company will enhance your skills as an
      investor.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Disregarding Fees</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Although there are numerous methods to acquire cryptocurrency,
      inexperienced investors may impulsively purchase it without comprehending
      the mechanics of gas fees on exchanges. For instance, buying
      cryptocurrency using a credit card could result in substantial surcharge
      fees (3% or higher), along with potential additional charges imposed by
      the card issuer. Gaining knowledge about crypto exchanges that offer
      minimal fees and identifying the most efficient approach for buying and
      trading cryptocurrency can lead to significant cost savings over time.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Lack of foresight</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The allure of quick wealth in the market leads many novice investors to
      solely focus on immediate results. Although investing in cryptocurrencies
      may offer the potential for substantial profits, there is also the risk of
      losing all your funds due to poor investment decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      If you take on a long-term mindset when investing in cryptocurrencies, it
      will enable you to make more cautious decisions and focus on selecting
      reputable projects that have proven themselves over a considerable period
      of time. Attempting to become wealthy in just 90 days is a risky approach
      that could end in financial ruin, whereas perceiving crypto investments as
      a long-term endeavor will assist you in constructing a well-considered
      portfolio.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Storing Cryptocurrency in Online Wallets</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that needs a digital wallet
      for storage. Although using an online wallet is convenient, it also comes
      with a higher risk compared to keeping your crypto offline. Online wallets
      are more susceptible to vulnerabilities, making it possible for hackers to
      steal your crypto through scams or hacks. To ensure maximum security, it
      is best to store your crypto in an offline hardware wallet. This type of
      wallet is essentially a USB stick equipped with advanced hardware and
      software encryption, designed to safeguard your crypto private keys.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Forgetting Passwords or Seed Phrases</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, it is
      necessary to have a password in order to access them. If you happen to
      forget your password, it may not be possible to retrieve your
      cryptocurrency. Many wallets offer a backup seed phrase as a means to
      regain access to your funds, however, if this seed phrase is misplaced or
      forgotten, there may be no other way to recover your funds.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">An incorrect wallet address</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Moving cryptocurrency between digital wallets is a way to assume control
      of your cryptocurrency from an exchange or to transfer funds from one
      entity to another. However, a frequent error made by new investors
      involves trying to transfer cryptocurrency funds to your wallet, only to
      mistakenly input the wrong wallet address. In such instances, the
      cryptocurrency is directed to an incorrect wallet address and might become
      irretrievable. Although there are services that specialize in recovery,
      they can come with substantial costs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Scams</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      In the realm of cryptocurrency, a relatively new asset class, there exists
      a pervasive presence of fraudulent activities. The Federal Trade
      Commission (FTC) disclosed a staggering figure of almost $700 million in
      pilfered cryptocurrency assets in 2021 alone. These wrongdoers employ
      intricate phishing methods to gain unauthorized entry into your
      cryptocurrency wallet and persuade you to transfer funds to their own
      wallet.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Crypto-related scams can occur via email or messaging applications,
      wherein perpetrators masquerade as acting in your best interest. Wallets
      may be compromised by simply linking an online wallet to an application
      and granting it permission to access funds. Although this practice is
      widespread among numerous cryptocurrency applications, scammers exploit
      this method to deplete the funds from cryptocurrency wallets.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      To circumvent these scams, refrain from connecting your online wallet to
      an untrustworthy application and opt to store the majority of your
      cryptocurrency funds in offline hardware wallets. Moreover, it is
      imperative to abstain from disclosing your wallet password, seed phrase,
      or private keys to anyone.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Too Complex Trading Approaches</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Beginner cryptocurrency investors diving into intricate trading methods
      based on recommendations from certain YouTubers may swiftly encounter
      financial losses and subsequently abandon the entire cryptocurrency realm.
      Understanding technical analysis, conditional orders, and comprehending
      the workings of cryptocurrency markets demands considerable time and
      effort.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      In reality, investing in cryptocurrency can be straightforward. There's no
      necessity to devise an elaborate trading strategy in an attempt to expand
      your portfolio. Much like traditional investing, you can adopt a
      dollar-cost averaging approach for cryptocurrency without engaging in
      active trading or constantly monitoring cryptocurrency charts round the
      clock.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6">Errors in Placing Orders</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      While certain cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, excel in
      simplifying the process of buying crypto, several others possess intricate
      order interfaces and trading platforms that may bewilder novice users.
      Within these platforms, a simple mistake involving a decimal point during
      order placement could lead to substantial financial losses, potentially
      magnifying the impact of these errors. For instance, a recent misstep
      resulted in a seller losing nearly $300,000 after unintentionally selling
      a high-value NFT for 0.75 Ether instead of the intended 75 Ether.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      To prevent such costly blunders, it's essential to consistently verify
      your orders or transfers prior to finalizing them. Given the irreversible
      nature of cryptocurrency transactions, it's prudent to exercise caution
      and ensure accuracy before proceeding with any transaction.
