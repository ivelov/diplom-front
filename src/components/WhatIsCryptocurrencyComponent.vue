    <h1 class="mb-2 text-center">What is cryptocurrency</h1>
    <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Cryptocurrencies is a digital or virtual currency that use concepts from
      cryptography, computer science, and economics. The decentralized
      functioning of cryptocurrencies is made possible by the collaboration of
      these three field:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
      <li>
        <b>Cryptographic methods</b> ensure the security of information related
        to cryptocurrency transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Computer science</b> ensures that this information remains consistent
        among all the individuals involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        The presence of <b>economic</b> incentives motivates all individuals to
        adhere to the regulations, ultimately benefiting the entire network.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-7">How does it work</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      There are similarities between emails and cryptocurrency transactions. The
      postal service is no longer necessary for personally delivering messages
      across the globe. We have the option to simply send emails directly via
      the internet. Crypto is equal. We are no longer dependent on banks for the
      storage and transportation of our money. We have the ability to possess
      cryptocurrency and transfer it directly to whomever we desire.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Decentralization is widely regarded as a fundamental attribute of the
      cryptocurrency industry. However, in the absence of any person in charge
      of supervising an essential function such as value transfer between
      individuals, it is unclear how a system can operate in this manner.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The solution in the form of a public ledger system consists of a
      blockchain and a global network of computers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      This is accomplished by putting in place regulations that are extremely
      safe and censorship-resistant. These protocols directly incorporate the
      rules and are generally available for personal examination by anybody in
      the world.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Every member of the peer network retains their individual and distinct
      version of the blockchain database. Every one of these nodes contributes
      to facilitating consensual acceptance of fresh data by the entire network
      prior to its inclusion in the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Blockchains basically delegate the task of verifying information to the
      majority of the network, as any endeavors to submit fraudulent data to the
      chain would require approval from the majority.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Here is another way to think of it. Instead of relying on a single person
      to determine the reliability of information, blockchains allow the
      community to decide whether a piece of information is true or false
      through voting. The community has the capability to evaluate the facts
      independently and reach a mutual agreement on whether the answer is
      affirmative or negative.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The method referred to as achieving a "consensus" is how this process is
      commonly known. In order to accomplish this, blockchains utilize
      proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or alternative consensus mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The term "blockchains" is derived from the way they link sequential
      "blocks" of data (like transaction information) by incorporating details
      from the preceding block into every new block.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      When each new block is connected to the block that came before it, any
      efforts to manipulate past information can be readily detected by all
      individuals involved in the network.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Modifying a single block of information necessitates the attacker to not
      only alter that specific block but also all subsequent blocks. For this
      modification to be successful, they would require the cooperation of most
      of the nodes in the network, comprising more than 50% of the total.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Due to the substantial level of coordination, financial resources, and
      computational capabilities that would be needed, executing such an attack
      has been shown to be extremely challenging if not unfeasible on widely
      utilized blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-7">Spheres of use</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Using crypto assets does not require studying cryptography or economics,
      just like driving a car does not require an understanding of mechanical
      engineering.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Just an internet connection and a device are required. Devices include
      smartphones, laptops, tablets, and desktop computers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Once you have just an internet connection, you will have various choices
      available to you when considering the purchase of cryptocurrency. Once you
      have purchased your cryptocurrency, it is crucial to undertake certain
      fundamental measures in order to safeguard your funds. After purchasing
      your cryptocurrency and ensuring its secure storage through a suitable
      method, you can explore various ways to utilize digital currency for
      varying objectives.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      There are various options for utilizing the most prevalent
      cryptocurrencies available in the current market:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
      <li>Transfer money quickly and affordably across different countries.</li>
      <li>
        By staking, you can receive rewards for ensuring the security of the
        protocol.
      </li>

    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-7">Types of cryptocurrency</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Typically, when cryptocurrency types are discussed, the primary focus is
      on the name of the particular coin. Nevertheless, the names of coins vary
      from the types of coins. Below is a list of various types along with a
      selection of token names belonging to each category:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
      <li>
        Transactional tokens are tokens that are specifically created to serve
        as a means of payment. Out of all these, Bitcoin holds the highest level
        of recognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Utility: tokens such as XRP and ETH serve as illustrations. They perform
        distinct purposes within their corresponding blockchains.
      </li>
      <li>
        Governance: These tokens symbolize the ability to vote or possess other
        rights within a blockchain network, like Uniswap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Platform: These tokens enable the functionality of applications designed
        for utilization within a blockchain, like Solana.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security tokens are tokens that symbolize possession of an asset, like a
        stock, which has been transformed into a token (with its value moved
        onto the blockchain). MS Token serves as an illustration of a token that
        has been securitized. In the event that you are able to locate one of
        these available for purchase, you will have the opportunity to obtain a
        share in the ownership of the Millenium Sapphire.
